# OpenPAI Marketplace Doc for Admins

In openpaimarketplace release v1.4.0 and later, the deployment has integrated into openpai cluster deployment process. Which means the deployment of narkeplace services will follow the standard process of deployment of other pai services (like webportal and rest-server). Therefore, we recommended users to use openpaimarketplace version v1.4.0 and later, and correspondingly deploy it in OpenPAI cluster version v1.4.0 and later.
